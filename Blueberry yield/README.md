I am currently working on developing this project as a part of my research work at AUburn University.

The main objective of this project is to perform deep learning based object-detection task of detecting ripe blueberries in the fields and predicting blueberry yield in the fields.

1. I have pre-trained an efficientnet-d4 .tflite model on my custom dataset to detect both green (unripe) and ripe berries
2. The DL model would be deployed on an android application to perform the prediction tasks
3. The android application would provide 4 different user-friendly applications
