<b>Blueberry yield prediction android application</b>

* I am currently working on developing this project as a part of my research work at Auburn University.

The main objective of this project is to perform deep learning based object-detection task of detecting ripe blueberries in the fields and predicting blueberry yield in the fields.

1. I have pre-trained an efficientnet-d4 .tflite model on my custom dataset to detect both green (unripe) and ripe berries
2. The DL model would be deployed on an android application to perform the prediction tasks
3. The android application would provide 3 different user-friendly applications for the user -
* Performing real-time blueberry detection and predicting yields
* Open camera - click an image - edit image, and than performing predictions and predicting yields
* Use images from the photo gallery on the android phone and using it to perform predition and predicting yield scores

This is an ongoing research project and I will continously update this fodler with the updated models and android application development
