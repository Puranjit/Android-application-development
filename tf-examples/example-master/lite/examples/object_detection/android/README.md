This folder contains files provided by official tensorflow library to build a real-time object detection android app that could use multiple .tflite models already trained on Coco dataset to generate predictions [Link](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android).<br>
I have integrated my custom object detection model trained to detect blueberries in different growth stages in this app as well

Some examples of the predictions done by the android application are attached:
