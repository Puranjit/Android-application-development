<h3>This android application performs real-time object detection tasks.</h3>
I have used the EfficientNet architecture model trained on the coco dataset to generate bounding-box based predictions, we could use different models to generate the predictions ![Link](https://tfhub.dev/s?deployment-format=lite&module-type=image-object-detection&tf-version=tf2)<br>

Some examples of the predictions done by the android application are attached: (You can click on these images to view them in a seperate window)<br>
